# Shor Code Error Correction Project


## Introduction
The Shor code is a quantum error correction code capable of correcting any single-qubit error, including bit-flips, phase-flips, or a combination of both. 
This project extends the fundamental concepts of quantum error correction, building upon the basic Bit-Flip and Phase-Flip codes to implement the Shor code using Qiskit. The project aims to simulate the Shor code, analyze its effectiveness, and compare it with scenarios where no error correction is used.


### Project Structure
The project is divided into the following main sections:

Part 1: Defining the Components
1. Implementing the Phase-Flip Code.
2. Implementing the Bit-Flip Code.

Part 2: Implementing the Shor Code
1. Combining the Phase-Flip and Bit-Flip codes to construct the Shor Code.
2. Simulating the Shor code with and without errors.

Part 3: Analyzing the Shor Code
1. Evaluating the effectiveness of the Shor code by measuring the fidelity of quantum states.
2. Comparing the Shor codeâ€™s performance with and without error correction.


### Requirements
1. Python 3.7+
2. Qiskit
3. Matplotlib


## Implementation Steps

### Part 1: Defining the Components
1.1 Implementing the Phase-Flip Code

The Phase-Flip code is the first part of the Shor code. The logical qubit is encoded into a 3-qubit code that protects against phase-flip errors.
1. Encoding Circuit: The logical qubit is entangled with two ancillary qubits using CNOT gates and placed in a superposition using Hadamard gates.
2. Correction Circuit: The correction circuit detects and corrects any phase-flip errors by checking the phases of the qubits and applying a Toffoli gate if necessary.

1.2 Implementing the Bit-Flip Code

The Bit-Flip code forms the second part of the Shor code. Each qubit from the Phase-Flip code is encoded into a 3-qubit Bit-Flip code.
1. Encoding Circuit: The logical qubit is entangled with two ancillary qubits using CNOT gates.
2. Correction Circuit: The correction circuit detects and corrects any bit-flip errors by checking the parity of the qubits and applying a Toffoli gate if necessary.


### Part 2: Implementing the Shor Code
The Shor code combines the Phase-Flip and Bit-Flip codes to protect against both types of errors.

1. Encoding:
   Each logical qubit is first encoded using the Phase-Flip code.
   Each resulting qubit from the Phase-Flip code is further encoded using the Bit-Flip code.
2. Correction:
   The encoded state is checked and corrected for Bit-Flip errors.
   The encoded state is then checked and corrected for Phase-Flip errors.


### Part 3: Analyzing the Shor Code
1. Fidelity Calculation: The state fidelity, which measures the similarity between the initial and final states, is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Shor 
   code.
2. Error Simulation: Errors are introduced at different probabilities to analyze how the Shor code performs under varying conditions.

### Comparison:
1. Without Error Correction: Fidelity decreases significantly with increasing error probability.
2. With Shor Code: Fidelity remains high up to a certain error probability, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Shor code.
