**Shor Code Error Correction Project**
Introduction
The Shor code is a quantum error correction code capable of correcting any single-qubit error, including bit-flips, phase-flips, or a combination of both. 
This project extends the fundamental concepts of quantum error correction, building upon the basic Bit-Flip and Phase-Flip codes to implement the Shor code using Qiskit. 
The project aims to simulate the Shor code, analyze its effectiveness, and compare it with scenarios where no error correction is used.
